Title: ADOL-C: A Package for the Automatic Differentiation of
 Algorithms Written in C/C++
Author: Andrea Walther and Andreas Griewank
Abstract: The C++ package ADOL-C described here facilitates the
 evaluation of first and higher derivatives of vector functions that
 are defined by computer programs written in C or C++. The resulting
 derivative evaluation routines may be called from C, C++, Fortran, or
 any other language that can be linked with C.
